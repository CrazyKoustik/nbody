## Presentation

Implementation of simple n-body gravitation simulation in "pure" python :

- One of the main aims of this project is to prove that it is not essential to use libraries such as numpy, matplotlib or simpy to perform mathematical and visualization tasks in python.

- This project aims to implement a n-body simulation (almost) from scratch, using as far as possible only python's built-in methods, and thus minimising the number of third-party dependencies (with the exception of Pillow and ffmpeg, which would be difficult to do without).

## Dependencies

### Pillow

The Pillow module is used to build images for visualisation.
You can install Pillow with pip :

```
pip install Pillow
```

### ffmpeg

ffmpeg is used to merge frames for animated visualizations.
Run the following command to install ffmpeg :

```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
